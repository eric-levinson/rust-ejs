# Rust EJS
This is a small Node server that uses Express, EJS View, [Request JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-json "Request JSON"), and [Rust Servers Info](rust-servers.info "Rust Servers Info") to give a real time look at your online Rust Server.

The pages have been designed from the ground up with [(MD)Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com "(MD)Bootstrap"). They have mobility and accessbility in mind.

 **I worked on this a good while ago. I figured I would go ahead and release this since I'm no longer doing Rust server hosting.**
